# Jetson Facelock Backend

FastAPI service handling user authentication, admin user management,
image-based face verification, audit logging, and MQTT door-control publishing
for the Jetson Facelock system.

The backend receives face images, extracts face embeddings internally, matches
them against stored user face vectors, writes an audit log entry, and publishes
the door command on a granted match. See [`../README.md`](../README.md) for the
system-level architecture.

For repository-wide setup, pre-commit hooks, CI behavior, and generated API
client workflow, see [../DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md). This file focuses
on backend-specific structure and operating notes.

## Setup

Use [../DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md) for the canonical local setup and
command reference.

The image-based face endpoints load YuNet and SFace ONNX files from
`backend/models/`. These files are downloaded by the backend model setup command
listed in the development guide and are intentionally ignored by Git.

Equivalent uvicorn command, useful when debugging server startup directly:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Environment

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for all variables and
[`../DEVELOPMENT.md`](../DEVELOPMENT.md) for the complete reference.

Setting `DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` together seeds an
admin user at startup; existing users are not overwritten.

## API Documentation

Run the development server and open the generated API documentation:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

FastAPI also exposes ReDoc at:

```text
http://localhost:8000/redoc
```

The OpenAPI schema is generated from the active application code, so use these
pages as the source of truth for available endpoints, request bodies, response
schemas, and authentication requirements.

## Development

Add dependencies:

```bash
uv add package-name
```

Create a migration after model changes:

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Run the full test suite:

```bash
uv run pytest tests -v
```

Run type checking:

```bash
uv run pyright main.py src tests alembic
```

Run coverage:

```bash
uv run pytest tests --cov
```

## Tech Stack

- FastAPI with the standard extras
- SQLModel and SQLAlchemy async sessions
- SQLite with `aiosqlite` for local development
- Alembic migrations
- Argon2id password hashing through `argon2-cffi`
- JWT authentication through `python-jose`
- NumPy for face vector storage and cosine similarity
- aiomqtt for async MQTT publishing to HiveMQ Cloud
- pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-cov, httpx, pyright, and ruff

## Troubleshooting

If settings fail with `SECRET_KEY not set or too short`, create `backend/.env`
from `.env.example` and set a generated secret value.

If tests create database files in the project directory, check that tests are
running through the provided `tests/conftest.py` fixtures. The default test
fixtures set `DATABASE_URL` to a per-test temporary database path.

If the server cannot import `main`, run commands from the `backend/` directory.
The app object is `main:app`.

If a database schema looks stale, run:

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```
